# Image Upload Fix Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem

The image upload functionality was failing with a "Not Found" error. This was caused by a series of issues in both the frontend and backend code.

### Root Causes:
1.  **Incorrect Frontend URL**: The frontend was making API calls to an incorrect endpoint (`/api/media/upload-image` and `/api/api/website-builder/upload-image` instead of `/api/website-builder/upload-image`).
2.  **Backend `NameError`**: The backend application was crashing on startup due to a `NameError` in `main.py`, which prevented the `media_router` from being loaded correctly.
3.  **Incorrect Backend URL Generation**: The backend was saving the image URL with an incorrect prefix (`/api/media` instead of `/api/website-builder`), which caused the frontend to request the image from the wrong location.

## âœ… Solution

The following steps were taken to resolve the issue:

1.  **Corrected Frontend API Calls**:
    *   Updated the `uploadImage` function in `client/src/services/websiteBuilderAPI.js` to use the correct endpoint: `/api/website-builder/upload-image`.
    *   Corrected a hardcoded URL in `client/src/components/WebsiteBuilder/MediaUploader.js`.

2.  **Fixed Backend `NameError`**:
    *   Corrected the order of operations in `backendv2/app/routes/media_upload.py` to ensure the `logger` was defined before being used.

3.  **Corrected Backend URL Generation**:
    *   Updated the `image_url` generation in `backendv2/app/routes/media_upload.py` to use the correct `/api/website-builder` prefix.

4.  **Thorough Testing**:
    *   Created a test script (`backendv2/test_image_upload.py`) to verify the fix.
    *   Used a valid JWT token to perform an authenticated test of the image upload endpoint.

##  Preventative Measures

To prevent this from happening again, the following best practices should be followed:

*   **Centralize API Calls**: All API calls should be centralized in the `api.js` and `websiteBuilderAPI.js` service files. Components should not be constructing their own API URLs.
*   **Use Environment Variables for Base URLs**: The base URL for the API should always be retrieved from environment variables to avoid hardcoding incorrect URLs.
*   **Implement Comprehensive Logging**: The backend should have detailed logging to make it easier to trace errors and diagnose problems.
*   **Run Integration Tests**: An integration test suite should be developed to automatically test critical functionality like image uploads before deploying to production.
