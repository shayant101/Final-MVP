1. âœ… **Safe Restore Point Created** - You can always return to this state
2. ðŸš€ **Begin Migration Implementation** - Start with Phase 1 (MongoDB Atlas setup)
3. ðŸ“‹ **Follow the 7-Week Roadmap** - Systematic implementation approach
4. ðŸ”„ **Regular Commits** - Commit progress at each phase milestone

## Commit Message Explanation

The commit message follows conventional commit format:
- `feat:` - Indicates a new feature addition
- Clear description of what was added
- Bullet points highlighting key components
- Professional format suitable for project history

This creates a clear checkpoint in your project history before beginning the major backend migration work.
