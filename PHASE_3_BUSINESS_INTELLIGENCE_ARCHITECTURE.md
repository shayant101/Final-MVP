## Database Indexes and Performance

### Critical Indexes
```javascript
// Revenue Analytics
db.revenue_analytics.createIndex({ "restaurant_id": 1, "date": -1 })
db.revenue_analytics.createIndex({ "date": -1 })

// Subscriptions
db.restaurant_subscriptions.createIndex({ "restaurant_id": 1 })
db.restaurant_subscriptions.createIndex({ "status": 1, "current_period_end": 1 })

// Billing
db.billing_invoices.createIndex({ "restaurant_id": 1, "invoice_date": -1 })
db.billing_invoices.createIndex({ "status": 1, "due_date": 1 })

// AI Assistant
db.ai_assistant_conversations.createIndex({ "admin_user_id": 1, "timestamp": -1 })
db.ai_insights_cache.createIndex({ "insight_type": 1, "generated_at": -1 })
```
