# Vertical Slice Migration Plan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines a revised migration strategy based on the "Vertical Slice Approach". The goal is to migrate the application one feature at a time, ensuring that each feature is fully functional before moving to the next. This approach will provide a more stable and predictable migration process.

## 2. Migration Slices (In Priority Order)

### Slice 1: Core Authentication & User Flow
- **Goal:** Implement a fully functional login and user authentication system.
- **Components:**
  - `Login.tsx`
  - `Navigation.tsx`
  - `ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement form handling and validation for login.
  - Integrate with `authAPI` for user authentication.
  - Implement token handling and protected routes.
  - Ensure navigation bar updates based on auth state.

### Slice 2: Admin Dashboard (Read-Only)
- **Goal:** Provide admins with a read-only view of the dashboard.
- **Components:**
  - `AdminDashboard.tsx`
  - `MainDashboard.tsx`
  - `RestaurantDashboard.tsx`
- **Tasks:**
  - Integrate with `dashboardAPI` to fetch and display data.
  - Implement data tables and visualizations.

### Slice 3: Admin Dashboard (Full Functionality)
- **Goal:** Implement all administrative functions.
- **Components:**
  - `FeatureManagement.tsx`

- **Tasks:**
  - Integrate with `adminAnalyticsAPI` and `billingAPI`.
  - Implement forms and modals for managing features, subscriptions, and content.
  - Ensure all admin actions are fully functional.

### Slice 4: Website Builder
- **Goal:** Migrate the full website builder functionality.
- **Components:**
  - All components under `WebsiteBuilder/`
- **Tasks:**
  - This is a large slice and may need to be broken down further.
  - Start with template selection and basic content editing.
  - Move to media uploads and advanced customization.

### Slice 5: Marketing & AI Features
- **Goal:** Migrate the marketing and AI-powered features.
- **Components:**
  - All remaining components.
- **Tasks:**
  - This slice can be broken down by individual feature (e.g., Image Enhancement, Business Intelligence).

## 3. Next Steps

The development team should begin with **Slice 1: Core Authentication & User Flow**. This is the most critical piece of functionality and will provide the foundation for all other features.

Once this plan is approved, the team can switch to "code" mode and begin implementation.
