## ðŸŽ¯ **DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY**

### **Recommended Deployment Approach**
1. **Blue-Green Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging environment first
   - Full testing in staging
   - Switch traffic to new version
   - Keep old version as backup

2. **Rollback Plan**
   - Database backup before deployment
   - Quick rollback procedure documented
   - Monitoring alerts configured
   - Emergency contact procedures

### **Deployment Steps**
1. **Pre-Deployment**
   - [ ] Create production database backup
   - [ ] Verify all environment variables
   - [ ] Test deployment scripts in staging
   - [ ] Notify stakeholders of deployment window

2. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Deploy backend to production server
   - [ ] Run database migrations
   - [ ] Deploy frontend to production
   - [ ] Verify all services are running

3. **Post-Deployment**
   - [ ] Run health checks
   - [ ] Verify authentication flow
   - [ ] Test critical user journeys
   - [ ] Monitor system performance
   - [ ] Confirm all integrations working
