## API Endpoints Documentation

### Authentication
All content generation endpoints require restaurant authentication via JWT token.

### Request/Response Format

#### Ad Copy Generation
```bash
POST /api/content/generate/ad-copy
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>

{
  "restaurant_name": "Mario's Italian Bistro",
  "item_to_promote": "Margherita Pizza",
  "offer": "20% off all pizzas this weekend",
  "target_audience": "pizza lovers"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "success": true,
    "ad_copy": "🍕 Craving something special? Mario's Italian Bistro has you covered!\n\nGet our famous Margherita Pizza with this amazing deal: 20% off all pizzas this weekend\nFresh ingredients, authentic flavors, unbeatable value!\nDon't miss out - limited time only!\n\n📍 Visit us or order online today!",
    "components": {
      "headline": "🍕 Craving something special? Mario's Italian Bistro has you covered!",
      "body": "Get our famous Margherita Pizza with this amazing deal: 20% off all pizzas this weekend\nFresh ingredients, authentic flavors, unbeatable value!\nDon't miss out - limited time only!",
      "cta": "📍 Visit us or order online today!"
    },
    "metadata": {
      "character_count": 241,
      "generated_at": "2025-06-28T10:53:20.123456",
      "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      "service": "openai"
    }
  },
  "restaurant_id": "restaurant_id_here"
}
```

### Error Handling

#### API Quota Exceeded
When OpenAI API quota is exceeded, the service automatically falls back to the mock service:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "success": true,
    "ad_copy": "Generated content from mock service",
    "metadata": {
      "service": "mock",
      "model": "gpt-4-turbo"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Invalid Request
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "detail": "Failed to generate ad copy: Invalid request parameters"
}
```

## Integration with Existing Features
