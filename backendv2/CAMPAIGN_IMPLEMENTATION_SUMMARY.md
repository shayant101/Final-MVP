# Phase 3: Campaign Management Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

### 🏗️ Architecture & Models
- **Campaign Data Models**: Comprehensive Pydantic models for Facebook Ads and SMS campaigns
- **Campaign Types**: `facebook_ad` and `sms` campaign types
- **Campaign Status**: `draft`, `active`, `paused`, `completed`, `pending_review`
- **Request/Response Models**: Structured data validation for all endpoints

### 🔧 Services Layer
- **Mock Facebook API** (`mock_facebook.py`): Simulates Facebook Marketing API
- **Mock Twilio API** (`mock_twilio.py`): Simulates SMS delivery service
- **Mock OpenAI API** (`mock_openai.py`): Generates ad copy and SMS messages
- **CSV Parser** (`csv_parser.py`): Handles customer data upload and validation
- **Campaign Service** (`campaign_service.py`): Business logic for campaign management
